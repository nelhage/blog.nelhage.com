If you want to chat about something, you can find me on IRC at
`##nelhage` on Freenode. I'm also available on various IM media and
Twitter, but IRC is my preferred place for longer conversation. You
should also just feel free to come hang out in-channel; we talk about
a variety of topics with similar scope to this blog.

If you don't have an IRC client already, I love [IRCCloud][irccloud],
which has a free version if you don't need to say connected. You could
also log in [using Freenode's own web
client][https://webchat.freenode.net/##nelhage].
