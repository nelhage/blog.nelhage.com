I finally got fed up with Blogger, and am moving this blog to live on
Wordpress hosted off of [scripts.mit.edu][scripts]. In the process of
converting everything over and setting up Wordpress I've decided I
hate it, but hopefully I hate it less than I hate Blogger. We'll see.

I've also changed the URL to this blog from
[http://nelhage.com/blog](http://nelhage.com/blog) to
[http://blog.nelhage.com](http://blog.nelhage.com), which I like
better as URL anyways. It should redirect to the toplevel of the new
URL now.
