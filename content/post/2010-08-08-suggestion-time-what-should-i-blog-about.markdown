I haven't been feeling very motivated to blog lately -- I've missed
the last two weeks of [Iron Blogger](http://iron-blogger.mit.edu/),
and I'm not totally enthusiastic about any of the items on my "to
blog" list.

But, I do enjoy blogging when I actually get into posts, and I'd like
to keep updating this blog. So, in a bit of a copout, and following in
[Edward's](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/07/suggestion-box/) footsteps,
this is an appeal to all of you: What should I blog about? I know far
too much about a lot of random things, so what would you find
interesting? Here's a list of some things on my list, areas I know too
much about, or otherwise things I could blog:

- Writeup of some cool techniques that are being used in JIT compilers
  to make languages like Python and Javascript faster.
- Why technologies like KVM and Virtuozzo terrify me from a security
  standpoint.
- A writeup of another exploit, either for Linux or something else.
- A writeup of the process of finding and exploiting an exploit in
  some piece of software.
- A writeup / internals guide of a simple Just-in-time [dynamic
  translator](http://github.com/nelhage/bemu/) I wrote to emulate a
  toy architecture used in some of MIT's intro CS classes.
- Something about git
- A writeup on some feature of the Linux kernel internals, including
  one of the memory allocators, or something else.
- Some random trivia about x86 architecture and ABI, with hands-on
  explorations

I'd love to hear what you think would be fun to read. I'll try to
follow-up for next week's post.
