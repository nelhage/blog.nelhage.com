I've posted <a href="https://nelhage.com/talks/kvm-defcon-2011.pdf">the final slides</a> from my talk this year at <a href="http://defcon.org/">DEFCON</a> and <a href="http://blackhat.com/">Black Hat</a>, on breaking out of the <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> Kernel Virtual Machine on Linux.

<b>[Edited 2011-08-11]</b> The <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/virtunoid">code is now available</a>. It should be fairly well-commented, and include links to everything you'll need to get the exploit up and running in a local test environment, if you're so inclined.

In addition, as I mentioned, this bug was found by a simple KVM fuzzer I wrote. I'm also going to clean that up and release it, but don't expect it too soon.

I had a great time meeting lots of interesting people at BlackHat and DEFCON, some that I'd met online and others I hadn't. If any of you are ever in Boston, drop me a note and we can grab a beer or something.
