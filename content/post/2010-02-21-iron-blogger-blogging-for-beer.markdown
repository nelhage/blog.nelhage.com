So, you may have noticed that I suddenly started updating this blog
for the first time in a while. The reason is that I've recently
started an ongoing event with a whole bunch of friends around here to
encourage us to blog more.

Like so many good ideas, it all started with a fundamentally simple
premise. On December 21, I sent the following message to Zephyr (MIT's
internal IM system -- like Twitter crossed with IRC, except older than
either)

<blockquote>
<p>I know a whole bunch of you have mentioned that you should blog more
often.</p>

<p>I propose that a bunch of us start blogs / dust off old ones, and
commit to updating regularly -- say a modest one post/week initially.
Every week, anyone who fails to update owes say $5 to a collective
beer fund. Every month or so, we all go out and enjoy drinks on the
tab of everyone who was lame. We also humiliate them as
appropriate.</p> </blockquote>

At the time, I expected maybe 6-10 people, at most, and we'd be able
to just go to a random bar in the area, get a table, and sit down. I
never expected what followed, which is that I've had 41 other people
create or revive blogs and join the event.

We've got a website now, where you can see [the current rules][rules]
and all of the [participants][participants].  I've written 250 lines
of Python to manage the site and weekly reports, which you can
download from [github][github].

In celebration of the two-month anniversary of that zephyr that
started this ridiculous event, here are some statistics, as of when I
write this. No doubt these numbers will change by 0600 tomorrow, when
this week's deadline rolls around.

So far, I count 307 blog bosts that have been made as part of Iron
Blogger, by 42 bloggers, for an average of 7.3 posts/person, or 0.8
posts/person/week. (This isn't quite accurate, in that some people
have joined late, so I shouldn't be counting them for all weeks, but
close enough).

In total, 64 weeks have been missed, for a total of $320 owed to the
beer pool, of which we spent $140 at the first meetup. It's probably
time for another one soon, although I think I will want to collect
more money before the event this time. There was a noticable
correlation between "people who owed a lot of money" and "people who
didn't show up to the first meetup" last time.

Happy blogging, everyone!
