With the announcement this week that <a
href="http://quora.com">Quora</a> had taken $11 million in VC at an
$86 million valuation, there's been an awful lot of attention on
Quora. I've had an account there and wanted to write up some of my
initial thoughts.

If you haven't heard about Quora, it's yet another question/answer
site on the web. People pose questions, and you can view questions and
answer them. I've heard it described as "StackOverflow, but for
anything", which is roughly true, even if I think they want to be
more. There are tons of Q&A sites out there, but I think there is
clearly room for more, or better ones -- none of them seem to get it
quite right in various ways.

Here's my thoughts/observations on Quora:

<ul>

<li><p>It's currently very much still inhabited primarily by the
Silicon Valley crowd. Half the questions seem to be about web startups
or related topics. I'm sure the userbase will branch out eventually,
but until it does, it's somewhat difficult to anticipate how the feel
will change.</p></li>

<li><p>I want it to be more real-time. I'm fairly good at using Google
to answer questions, so if I post a technical question, it's usually
just because I'm too lazy to go digging myself. But if I don't get an
answer back quickly, I'll tend to time out and just go do the work
myself. In my experience, it hasn't been fast enough to avoid that
timeout.  </p>

<p> I do have the advantage that if I want opinons or answers to more
subjective questions, I can ask <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(protocol)">Zephyr</a>,
MIT's instant messaging network, which I describe as somewhat like a
cross between IRC and Twitter. It's possible there's more value here
for people who don't have that resource.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p> Quora seems to encourage a model where users respond with
mostly-distinct, authoritative answers, rather than being a forum
where the community can collaboratively work together to converge on
the answer to a question. I don't know how this compares to other Q&A
sites (I don't really use any of them), but when someone on Zephyr
asks a question, it's quite common for one person to throw out a guess
(noted as such), or partial answer, and for whoever else is around to
start from that guess and go to Google, Wikipedia, or other
references, reporting progress as they go, until they arrive at a
satisfactory answer.  </p>

<p> I would love to see a Q&A site for the web that harnesses the same
sort of collaboration to find answers to questions that no single
person already knows the full answer to.  Quora isn't that (yet?), and
so it remains much less useful to me than Zephyr. I'll be curious to
follow where it goes, though. $11 million probably opens a lot of
possibilities.</p>

</li>
</ul>
