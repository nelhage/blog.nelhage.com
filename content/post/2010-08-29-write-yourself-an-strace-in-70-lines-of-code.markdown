Basically anyone who's used Linux for any amount of time eventually
comes to know and love the [`strace`][strace] command. `strace` is the
system-call tracer, which traces the calls that a program makes into
the kernel in order to interact with the outside world. If you're not
already familiar with this incredibly versatile tool, I suggest you go
check out my friend and coworker Greg Price's excellent [blog
post][priceblog] on the subject, and then come back here.

We all love strace, but have you ever wondered how it works? How does
it interject itself between the kernel and the userspace program? This
post will walk through a minimal implementation of `strace` in about
70 lines of C. It won't be nearly as functional as the real thing, but
in the process you'll learn most of what you need to know about the
core interfaces it uses.

On Linux (and probably some other UNIXes) `strace` uses a somewhat
arcane interface known as [`ptrace`][ptrace], the process-tracing
interface. `ptrace` allows one proccess to monitor the status of
another process, and to inspect (or even manipulate) its internal
state.

`ptrace` is a complex system call, taking a magic "request" first
parameter, and doing completely different things depending on its
value. Its general prototype looks like:

```c
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);
```
However, because different values of `request` use anywhere from zero
to three of the remaining parameters, `glibc` prototypes it as a
varargs function, allowing a a developer to only list as many
parameters as a given call needs.

In order for one process to trace another, it attaches to that
process, and temporarily becomes that process's parent. When a process
is `ptrace`d, the tracer can ask for the child to stop whenever
various events happen, such as the child making a system call. When
this happens, the kernel will stop the child with `SIGTRAP`. Since the
tracer is now the child's parent, it can thus watch for this using the
standard UNIX `waitpid` system call.

Our miniature `strace` will only support the `strace COMMAND` form of
`strace` (as opposed to `strace -p`), and we'll only print syscall
numbers and return values -- no decoding of names or arguments or
anything. So a sample run might look like:

```shell
$ ./ministrace ls
…
syscall(6) = 0
syscall(54) = 0
syscall(54) = 0
syscall(5) = 3
syscall(221) = 1
syscall(220) = 272
syscall(220) = 0
syscall(6) = 0
syscall(197) = 0
syscall(192) = -1219706880
…
```

Not the most useful thing in the world, but it shows off the core
tracing tools. So, let's see the code:

```c
#include <sys/ptrace.h>
#include <sys/reg.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
````

We start with the necessary headers. `sys/ptrace.h` defines `ptrace`
and the `__ptrace_request` constants, and we'll need `sys/reg.h` to
help decode system calls. More about that later. Everything else is
likely familiar to C veterans.

```c
int do_child(int argc, char **argv);
int do_trace(pid_t child);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s prog args\n", argv[0]);
        exit(1);
    }

    pid_t child = fork();
    if (child == 0) {
        return do_child(argc-1, argv+1);
    } else {
        return do_trace(child);
    }
}
```

We'll start with the entry point. We check that we were passed a
command, and then we `fork()` to create two processes -- one to
execute the program to be traced, and the other to trace it.

```c
int do_child(int argc, char **argv) {
    char *args [argc+1];
    memcpy(args, argv, argc * sizeof(char*));
    args[argc] = NULL;
```

The child starts with some trivial marshalling of arguments, since
`execvp` wants a `NULL`-terminated argument array.

```c
    ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME);
    kill(getpid(), SIGSTOP);
    return execvp(args[0], args);
}
```

Next, we just execute the provided argument list, but first, we need
to start the tracing process, so that the parent can start tracing the
newly-executed program from the very start.

If a child knows that it wants to be traced, it can make the
`PTRACE_TRACEME` `ptrace` request, which starts tracing. In addition,
it means that the next signal sent to this process wil stop it and
notify the parent (via `wait`), so that the parent knows to start
tracing. So, after doing a `TRACEME`, we `SIGSTOP` ourselves, so that
the parent can continue our execution with the `exec` call.

(You might have noticed that `strace COMMAND` output always starts
with an `execve` call. Now you should understand why -- we're actually
going to start tracing immediately after the `kill` returns, so we see
the `execve` call that starts the new program).

```c
int wait_for_syscall(pid_t child);

int do_trace(pid_t child) {
    int status, syscall, retval;
    waitpid(child, &status, 0);
```

In the parent, meanwhile, we prototype a function we'll need later,
and start tracing. We immediately `waitpid` on the child, which will
return once the child has sent itself the `SIGSTOP` above, and is
ready to be traced.

```c
    ptrace(PTRACE_SETOPTIONS, child, 0, PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD);
```

I mentioned earlier that `ptrace` turns basically all events into a
`SIGTRAP` on the child. This is inconvenient because it means that
when you see the child has stopped due to `SIGTRAP`, there's no good
way to know which of several possible reasons it stopped for.

`PTRACE_SETOPTIONS` lets us set a number of options for how we want to
trace the child. We use it here to set `PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD`, which
means that when the child stops for a syscall-related reason, we'll
actually see it stopped with signal number `SIGTRAP | 0x80`, so we can
easily distinguish syscall stops from other stops. Since (for the
purposes of this demo), we only care about syscalls, this is very
convenient.

```c
    while(1) {
        if (wait_for_syscall(child) != 0) break;
```

Now we enter the tracing loop. `wait_for_syscall`, defined below, will
run the child until either entry to or exit from a system call. If it
returns non-zero, the child has exited and we end the loop.


```c
        syscall = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, child, sizeof(long)*ORIG_EAX);
        fprintf(stderr, "syscall(%d) = ", syscall);
```

Otherwise, though, we know that the child is entering a system call,
and so we need to decode the system call number (and potentially
arguments, if this were a less toy example). The `PTRACE_PEEKUSER`
`ptrace` request reads a word of data from the child's "user area",
which is a logical area that holds all of its registers and other
internal non-memory state. On i386, the syscall number lives in
`%eax`. For various technical reasons, however, the kernel has already
clobbered the child's `%eax` at this point, but it saves the original
value at a different offset, `ORIG_EAX`, which comes from
`sys/regs.h'.

```c
        if (wait_for_syscall(child) != 0) break;
```

Once we have the syscall number, we `wait_for_syscall` again, which
should leave us stopped at the syscall return.

```c
        retval = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, child, sizeof(long)*EAX);
        fprintf(stderr, "%d\n", retval);
```

Return values on i386 are also passed in `%eax`, so this time we can
read it directly and print the return value, and then return to the
top of the loop to wait for the next syscall.

```c
    }
    return 0;
}
```

And once the child exits, we just return.

```c
    int wait_for_syscall(pid_t child) {
        int status;
        while (1) {
            ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, child, 0, 0);
```

`wait_for_syscall` is a simple helper function. We continue the child
using `PTRACE_SYSCALL`, which allows a stopped child to continue
executing until the next entry to or exit from a system call.

```c
        waitpid(child, &status, 0);
```

We then `waitpid` to wait for something interesting to happen in the
child.

```c
        if (WIFSTOPPED(status) && WSTOPSIG(status) & 0x80)
            return 0;
```

Because of the `PTRACE_O_SYSGOOD` we set above, we can detect a
syscall stop by checking if the child was stopped by a signal with the
high bit set. If so, we return.

```c
        if (WIFEXITED(status))
            return 1;
    }
}
```

If the child exited, we're done here; Otherwise, it stopped for some
reason we don't care about (like an `execve`, for instance), and so we
loop to start it again until it hits a syscall.

And that's all there is to it. You can find the version I just posted on
[github][for-blog] if you want to download and try it out.

Making it more useful
---------------------

While it works, the previous version isn't exactly what I'd call particularly
helpful. You have to decode the syscall numbers by hand, and you don't get any
syscall arguments.

It's a little long to include in the post, but I've pushed a slightly more
functional version to [master][master] in the same github repository. It
includes a Python script to scan the Linux source to pick up syscall numbers and
argument counts and types, and it knows how to decode string arguments, so that
you can see filenames and `read` and `write` data.

[master]: http://github.com/nelhage/ministrace/tree/master

Reading arguments is easy -- on i386, they're passed in registers, so it's just
another `PTRACE_GETUSER` for each argument. Perhaps the most interesting piece
is the `read_string` function, which is used to read a NULL-terminated string
from the child process. (Of course, NULL-terminated isn't quite right -- the
real strace knows about the `count` arguments to `read()` and `write()`, for
instance. But it's close enough for a demo):

```c
char *read_string(pid_t child, unsigned long addr) {
```

`read_string` takes a child to read from, and the address of the string it's
going to read.

```c
    char *val = malloc(4096);
    int allocated = 4096, read;
    unsigned long tmp;
```

We need some variables. A buffer to copy the string into, counters of how much
data we've copied and allocated, and a temporary variable for reading memory.

```c
    while (1) {
        if (read + sizeof tmp > allocated) {
            allocated *= 2;
            val = realloc(val, allocated);
        }
```

We grow the buffer if necessary. We read data one word at a time.

```c
        tmp = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, child, addr + read);
        if(errno != 0) {
            val[read] = 0;
            break;
        }
```

`PTRACE_PEEKDATA` returns a work of data from the child at the specified
offset. Because it uses its return for the value, we need to check `errno` to
tell if it failed. If it did (perhaps because the child passed an invalid
pointer), we just return the string we've got so far, making sure to add our own
NULL at the end.

```c
        memcpy(val + read, &tmp, sizeof tmp);
        if (memchr(&tmp, 0, sizeof tmp) != NULL)
            break;
        read += sizeof tmp;
```

Then it's a simple matter of appending the data we read, and breaking out if we
found a terminating NULL, or else looping to read another word.

```c
    }
    return val;
}
```
