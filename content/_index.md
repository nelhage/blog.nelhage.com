# Made of Bugs

Welcome to the home of Nelson Elhage's writing on the web. I am a software engineer with wide-ranging interests, and this is where I write about them.

## My favorites

Here are some of my favorite articles you might want to start with:

- [Computers can be understood](/post/computers-can-be-understood/), where I explain an important part of my philosophy of and approach to software engineering.
- [Reflections on performance](/post/reflections-on-performance/), thoughts on software performance and performance engineering.
- [Why the Sorbet typechecker is fast](/post/why-sorbet-is-fast/), where I explore how we made the [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org) typechecker so fast.
- [Test suites as classifiers](/post/test-suites-as-classifiers/), in which I argue for thinking of test suites as binary classifiers predicting the answer to the question "Is this change safe to ship?"
- [My Apollo Bibliography](/post/apollo-bibliography/), where I share my favorite books and movies about the Apollo program.
- [A brief introduction to termios](/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios/). Ever wondered what _really_ happens when you press Control-C in a terminal? Or what that funny editing mode you get when you run a bare `cat` command was? This three-post series will answer these questions, and more.
- [Indices point between elements](/2015/08/indices-point-between-elements/), in which I think a bit too deeply about how to reason about indexing into arrays.
- [How reptyr works](2011/02/changing-ctty/). I'm the author of the [reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr) tool for moving processes between terminals, and this post explains the crux of how that tool works.

## Other writing

I have an (unfortunate?) proliferation of blogs and other sites on the internet. Here are some other places I write things:

- [Musings on computer systems](https://buttondown.email/nelhage/), my weekly newsletter.
- [Accidentally Quadratic](https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com), a tumblr where I chronicle cases of software performance problems caused by accidental quadratic iteration.
- [nelhage debugs shit](https://nelhagedebugsshit.tumblr.com/), another tumblr with an even less-edited tone than this one, where I recount war stories and interesting bugs I've tracked down in the past.
- I've written [for the Stripe blog](https://stripe.com/blog/distributed-ruby-testing) about the distributed test running architecture we built there.
