intro: |
  You've found the home of Nelson Elhage's writing on the
  web. I'm a software engineer with wide-ranging interests, and
  this is where I write about them.

favorites:
- page: /post/computers-can-be-understood
  blurb: |
   An exploration of a key aspect of my personal philosophy of and approach to software engineering: Computers and software generally _can be understood_ and reasoned about.
- page: /post/reflections-on-performance
  blurb: Some thoughts from career so far on software performance and on performance engineering.
- page: /post/test-suites-as-classifiers
  blurb: |
    I explore a perspective of viewing test suites as binary classifiers over changesets, which attempt to predict the answer to the question: "Is this change safe to ship?"
- page: /post/2015-07-17-indices-point-between-elements
  blurb: |
    This post argues for changing the way you think about a very basic concept in programming / software engineering: array indexing and indices. I make the case for conceptualizing/visualizing them as denoting the positions *between* elements in an array, rather than naming the elements themselves.
- page: /post/apollo-bibliography
  blurb: I'm -- like so many nerds -- endlessly fascinated with the early US space program and the Apollo missions in particular. I've attempted to collect my personal list of favorite books and movies for learning more about that program and how it worked, both technically and organizationally.
- page: /post/2009-12-22-a-brief-introduction-to-termios
  blurb: |
    Ever wondered what _really_ happens when you press Control-C in a terminal? Or what that funny editing mode you get when you run a bare `cat` command was? This three-post series will answer these questions, and more.
- page: /post/2011-01-21-reptyr-attach-a-running-process-to-a-new-terminal.markdown
  blurb: |
    I'm the author of the [reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr) tool, which lets you move processes between terminal windows. It's a fun bit of low-level UNIX trickery, and this post explains the crux of how that tool works.

## Other writing

I have a small proliferation of blogs and other sites on the internet. Here are some other places I write things:

- [Accidentally Quadratic](https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com), a tumblr where I chronicle cases of software performance problems caused by accidental quadratic iteration.
- [nelhage debugs shit](https://nelhagedebugsshit.tumblr.com/), another tumblr with an even less-edited tone than this one, where I recount war stories and interesting bugs I've tracked down in the past.
